I'm a Biologist, graduate student of the InterAmerican University of PR,
Science Master program in Bioinformatics and researcher of the Microbiome Laboratory in the Medical Science Campus-UPR.  
I’ve been at ML since 2015. I’ve done research on microbial communities structures with marker gene survey data,
and some research in metabolic profiles with biological samples published in 2018. I have worked in a wide variety of routine lab procedures, but I most enjoy working in data analysis and visualizations - both challenging and rewarding.
