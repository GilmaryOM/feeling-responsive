I'm a Biologist, graduate student of the InterAmerican University, Science Master program
in Bioinformatics and volunteer researcher of the Microbiome Laboratory in the Medical Science Campus-UPR.  
I’ve been at ML since 2015. I’ve done research on microbial communities structures with marker gene survey data,
and untargeted metabolomics procedure published in 2018. I have worked in a wide variety of routine lab procedures, 
but I most enjoy working in computer softwares for data analysis and visualization - both challenging and rewarding.
